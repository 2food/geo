# Geo

At Factual, we process a lot of spatial data. We're open-sourcing one of our
internal libraries for working with geospatial information, especially
geohashes. We want all Clojure programmers to be able to answer questions about
coordinates, distances, and polygon intersections. We think this library will
be particularly useful in concert with our [rich API of geospatial
information](http://developer.factual.com/).

We unify three open-source JVM geospatial libraries: The [JTS topology
library](http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm),
[spatial4j](https://github.com/spatial4j/spatial4j), and
[geohash-java](https://clojars.org/la.tomoj/geohash-java). Clojure protocols
allow these libraries' disparate representations of points and shapes to
interoperate, so you can, for instance, ask whether a JTS point is within a
geohash, or whether a geohash intersects a spatial4j multipolygon.

In addition, we provide common scales and translation functions for unit
conversion: converting between steradians and surface areas; finding the radius
along the geoid, and some basic properties.

This library is incomplete; in particular, it is not as fast as it could be,
encounters bounded errors when translating between various geoid
representations, and is subject to singularities at the poles. Nonetheless, we
hope that it can be a canonical resource for geospatial computation in Clojure.

# Examples

```clj

user=> (def london (spatial/spatial4j-point 51.5072 0.1275))
user=> (spatial/intersects? lhr (spatial/circle london 50000))
true

; But it's not in the downtown area
user=> (spatial/intersects? lhr (spatial/circle london 10000))

; At London, how many bits of geohash do we need for 100m features?
user=> (-> london (spatial/circle 50) geohash/shape->precision)

# Namespace overview

## geo.spatial

Provides common interfaces for working with spatial objects and geodesics. All
units are in meters/radians/steradians unless otherwise specified; coordinates
are typically in long/lat "degrees" (which are *not* angular degrees). Provides
static spatial contexts for the earth, and some constants like the earth's
radii and circumferences, along with points like the poles.

Defines protocols for unified access to Points and Shapes, to allow different
geometry libraries to interoperate.

Basic utility functions for unit conversion; e.g. degrees<->radians.

Functions for computing earth radii, surface distances, and surface areas.

Constructors for shapes like bounding-boxes and circles, and utility functions
over shapes for their heights, centers, areas, etc. Can also compute
relationships between shapes: their intersections, contains, disjoint statuses,
etc.

## geo.poly

Polygon operations: primarily intersection testing, point-contains,
polygon->edges, bounding boxes, normal vectors, linear coordinates, bisections,
box intersections, bounded-space partitioning, and so on.

## geo.jts

Wrapper for the vividsolutions JTS spatial library. Constructors for points,
coordinate sequences, rings, polygons, multipolygons, and so on.

## geo.geohash

Defines geohashes using the ch.hsr.geohash library, and extends them to support
the Shapelike protocol; these geohashes can then interoperate with jts polygons
and other shapes, and support the full range of shape and intersection queries.

Given a geohash, can find neighbors in each directions, and compute concentric
square rings around that geohash. Extract centerpoints and dimensions, either
via horizontal/vertical extent or estimated areas. Estimate errors for specific
geohashes--error is largest at the equator and smallest at the poles.
Round-trip geohashes to and from base32.

Given a target shape on the geoid, can tell you how many bits of precision are
necessary to get geohashes on roughly that scale. Can compute all geohashes
intersecting a shape in general, and all geohashes within a radius of a point
in specific.

# Tests

The project uses [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje/).

## How to run the tests

`lein midje` will run all tests.

`lein midje namespace.*` will run only tests beginning with "namespace.".

`lein midje :autotest` will run all the tests indefinitely. It sets up a
watcher on the code files. If they change, only the relevant tests will be
run again.
